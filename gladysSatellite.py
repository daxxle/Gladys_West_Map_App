        This first part of this function to read satelite data only read
        satellite data. students need to change the pathToJSONDataFiles
        variable so it works on your computer.

        this is *windows* path, not a mac path.
        if you do not know what a path (on a computer) is, you
        should use google and
        youtube to learn, or come to office hours so I can explain it to you.

        students will need to change this pathToJSONDataFiles variable
        to point to where you have the data files stoed on your computer.
        If you do not change it, the code will not "work".

        You can/should remove this long comment before you submit your work.
        I'm just giving advice to try to help you. Good luck!  -Gabriel :)
